Perfect for hiking or carrying when you are going someplace you MAY need a quick closeup. I bought it to leave in my glovebox so I always have it with me. I've used it a few times already and couldn't be happier with it. For the price, it's definitely worth picking up if you are looking for a good monocular.  \n",

It's not by Canon. It's some generic brand that i've never heard of. HOWEVER, it works surprisingly well! The sound quality is actually really good. The wire is actually super long and is perfect for indoor shooting.  "
